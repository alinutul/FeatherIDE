<b> AI implementation!</b>
FeatherIDE integrates AI assistance through Ollama, allowing you to run powerful language models locally. This means you can get instant code suggestions, debugging help, and problem-solving tips without sending your code to external servers. AI support can speed up your workflow, help you understand problems faster, and even suggest optimal solutions during competitions â€” all while keeping your data private.
